# Military-Camouflage-Detection
Detecting camouflaged objects in military environments is a critical 
challenge due to their ability to blend seamlessly with diverse terrains. 
This project aims to address this issue by leveraging advanced deep 
learning techniques. The proposed solution utilizes state-of-the-art 
models like YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time detection and 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for accurate feature extraction. 
 The project leverages the Military Assets Dataset, which contains 12 
classes of military objects annotated in the YOLOv8 format, designed for 
real-time object detection applications. This dataset enables the training 
of advanced deep learning models to detect camouflaged and diverse 
military assets such as tanks & jets. To enhance detection accuracy and 
efficiency, the project employs advanced activation functions like Swish, 
RELU for smooth gradient flow, optimization algorithms such as Adam for 
better generalization, and hybrid model architectures that combine 
YOLOv8 with transformer-based methods. These techniques ensure 
robust performance in detecting camouflaged objects across varied 
terrains and lighting conditions, making the system highly suitable for 
military and surveillance applications. 
To enhance the model's robustness, data augmentation techniques are 
employed to simulate complex camouflage scenarios. The system is 
trained and fine-tuned on specialized datasets to achieve high accuracy 
and efficiency. The outcomes demonstrate significant improvements in 
detecting camouflaged objects, providing a reliable tool for military 
applications. This work contributes to advancing object detection 
technologies, improving situational awareness, and ensuring operational 
safety in critical missions.


A deep learning-based system for detecting and classifying camouflaged military objects in real-time to enhance situational awareness and improve operational safety.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Camouflage is designed to conceal military personnel and assets by blending them with their environment. This project aims to overcome the detection challenge using advanced deep learning techniques.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop a real-time model to detect camouflaged military objects (soldiers, tanks, jets, etc.).
- Use CNNs and hybrid architectures to tackle the visibility challenges of camouflage.
